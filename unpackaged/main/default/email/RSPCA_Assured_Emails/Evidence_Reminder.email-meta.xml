    <textOnly>Dear {!Application__c.Applicant_Full_Name__c} &lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Corrective evidence&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Don’t forget, you must submit your corrective actions and evidence by {!Application__c.Evidence_Deadline__c}&lt;br&gt;
This is an automated reminder, so if you have already submitted the evidence and pink report you can ignore this email.&lt;br&gt;
Please email all supporting evidence including the pink report left by the assessor. Once done please send to help@rspcaassured.org.uk on a separate email quoting your membership number and farm name.  Please note that the pink report needs to include your corrections to the non-compliances raised with a signature and date to show rectification of this &lt;br&gt;
If we do not receive your corrective actions and evidence on time your membership maybe suspended and you may have to reapply.&lt;br&gt;
If you need any help please get in touch with our Membership Services team on 01403 286170 or help@rspcaassured.org.uk.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Yours sincerely 
&lt;b&gt;Membership services RSPCA Assured &lt;/b&gt;

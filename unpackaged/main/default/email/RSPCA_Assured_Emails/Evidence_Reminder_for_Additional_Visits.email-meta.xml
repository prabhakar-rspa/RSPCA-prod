Dear Member,

{!Application__c.Site_Name__c} {!Application__c.Membership_Number__c}

Further to your recent Additional Visit, please ensure you submit your corrective actions and evidence by {!Application__c.Evidence_Deadline__c}

This is an automated reminder, so if you have already submitted the evidence and pink report you can ignore this email.

Please email all supporting evidence together with the pink report left by the assessor.  Please note the pink report must include your corrections to the non-compliances raised with a signature and date to show rectification of this. Once done please send to help@rspcaassured.org.uk quoting your membership number and farm name.

If we do not receive your corrective actions and evidence on time your membership may be suspended and you may have to reapply.

If you need any help please get in touch with our Membership Services Team on 01403 286170 or help@rspcaassured.org.uk.

Yours sincerely

Membership Services
RSPCA Assured
